% Added -all- and -erpimage- options for cells in View Waves function.
%
% bugfix 3/9/18 JD
% Fixed cells popupmenu listing all trials rather than just one of each name.
%
% bugfix 3/27/18 JD
% Fixed crash when performing scree on second step of a two-step PCA.
%
% modified 4/29/18 JD
% Added support for calculation of RT and accuracy summary scores during averaging.
% Added support for outputting behavioral data in the Window function.
% Added support for View Topos listing all trials or cells or subjects.
% Cell box for Window Data function now allows blanks so may edit freely to change order or to drop cells.  'none' no longer recognized as a keyword.
% Cell box for Window Data function no longer sorting cell names alphabetically for average files.
% Window Data pane settings no longer resetting every time one leaves the pane.
%
% bugfix 5/13/18 JD
% Fixed crash sometimes when starting Window Data pane.
%
% bugfix 5/18/18 JD
% Fixed failing to perform PCA scree test when noise field consists of zeros.
%
% bugfix & modified 6/5/18 JD
% Added preference option to turn off BV header encoding.
% Sorts batch files by name prior to running ANOVAs, averages, and preprocessing.
% Fixed not adding new cells as adds (if enabled) if new cell names specified during windowing.
% Fixed crash during ANOVA if a cell name is specified that is not present in the original data if adds are enabled.
% Fixed crash in Save function when clicking on table rather than using Convert mode.
% Don't remove star for unsaved data when save is cancelled for whatever reason.
% Added option to add marks for RT and selected events to View figures.
