function [chunkNum] = ep_chunkInputFile(data, fnameout, chunkSize)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% [chunkNum] = ep_chunkInputFile(data, fnameout, chunkSize)%                         writes out EP format data in chunks.%%   writes out data in chunks of chunkSize samples in length, except for%   the final two which are the size of the remaining samples divided in two.%	This is done to ensure that each chunk will be of sufficent size to%	characterize blinks with ICA.  Output file consists of the data structure%   with relevant fields (e.g., data, cellNames, etc. subset into chunks).%%Inputs%  EPdata         : Structured array with the data and accompanying information.  See readData.%	fnameout: Filename of output file.%	chunkSize: Number of samples to put in each sub file.%%Outputs%	chunkNum: Array of number of trials in each chunk.%% History:%% by Joseph Dien (10/00)% jdien07@mac.com%% modified 5/26/02 JD% added cross-platform endian support.  chunks will no longer cut trials in half.  % Correction made so filenames with a period do not cause errors.%% modified 10/11/02 JD% Moved chunk size check into this function so would not have to manually% specify trial size in blinkCorrection script.%% modified 10/20/02 JD% chunkSize does not have to be exact.  Program will figure exact number.%% modified 5/27/03 JD% Changed name to segmentEGISses from readEGISses for clarity's sake.  Fixed size% of last chunk when the last two are different sizes to avoid cutting a trial% in two.%% bugfix 4/1/04 JD% Allow for spaces in file names.%% modified (8/20/08) JD% Changed format of rd_PCAegis_hdr_v call.  Cleaned up endian code.%% modified (11/18/08) JD% Changed to use FieldTrip I/O in order to be able to read more formats.% Changed name to chunkInputFile to reflect this more general function.%% bugfix (11/24/08) JD% size of last chunk for multiple chunks not being figured correctly.%% modified (1/31/09) JD% allows for data with multiple events per trial but only one at stimulus onset.%% modified (2/9/09) JD% Dropped trialsize output field.%% modified 3/14/09 JD% Changed to use EP format data to provide more flexibility with I/O functions.%% modified 9/22/09 JD% Modified to handle continuous files.% Size of last two chunks for multiple chunks not being figured correctly.%% bugfix 10/31/09 JD% Crash when only one chunk and less trials than maximum allowed by chunk size.% Crash when more than two chunks.%% bugfix 11/2/09 JD% When there are multiple chunks, the last two are miscalculated such that they are data from earlier chunks.% Thanks to Siri Kamp.%% bugfix 11/10/09 JD% When there are multiple chunks, crash when there is an odd number of trials.%% bugfix 3/9/10 JD% When there are multiple chunks, crash when there is an odd number of trials.% %  modified 10/17/10 JD%  Added support for saccadeTrials and saccadeOnset fields.%% bugfix 6/12/12 JD% Fixed continuous files not handling .analysis fields correctly, resulting in crashes in later functions.%%  bufix 3/11/14 JD%  Handles decimal sampling rates gracefully.%%  bufix 4/8/14 JD%  Fixed retaining only editing information (in .analysis field) for first subject for average files, leading to crashes%  down the line.%% bugfix 12/14/15 JD% Fixed crash for continuous data.%% bugfix 1/29/18 JD% Fixed not chunking single-trial data correctly, leading to crashes.% %  modified 2/3/18 JD%  Changed chunkNum output to array of chunk sizes.%% bugfix 4/1/18 JD% Fixed not chunking average data correctly, leading to crashes.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     Copyright (C) 1999-2008  Joseph Dien%%     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify%     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by%     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or%     (at your option) any later version.%%     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,%     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of%     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
